		<p>I chose a new story at the last minute about zombies invading a friends apartment for froyo and ended up liking strawberries. I did this because I know to much about the IP cameras and it was causing me to over complicate the assignment rather then having fun and focusing on the assignment. Zombies are the bacon of story telling, so it was the obvious choice. </p>
